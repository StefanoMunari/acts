# Utils

Utility component which contains several data structures and procedures shared
across this whole Umbrella project.

## Installation in other apps under the umbrella

Add `utils` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs` (of the non-`utils` app):

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:utils, , in_umbrella: true}]
    end
    ```
